# Presentations
  * Cart Recommendations: Model update regarding recommendations model on the cart page.
  * Complementarity: A literature survey on papers that help us make models that guide users toward buying complementary items. For instance, if a user buys a toothbrush, then our model should nudge them to also buy toothpaste.
  * ML toolkit: a gentle introduction to ML for engineers.
  * OPFY on CSR: How we made the transition from offline inference to online inference.
  * Using Sahale Effectively: some guidance on using our open source [library](https://github.com/etsy/Sahale) for visualizing progress of [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding) jobs.
  * Within Session Personalization: our plan for using KafkaStreams to perform online training and inference for a model.
